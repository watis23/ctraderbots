Please note that the trading bots presented here were developed exclusively for testing purposes. They are intended to demonstrate and explore algorithmic trading strategies and are not intended for use in real trading scenarios. 

Everyone is welcome to edit the code as they wish. I'm also looking forward to your changes/suggestions

No real-time data: The bots may work on historical or simulated data and do not reflect current market conditions.
No Guarantee of Profit: Results achieved by these test bots do not guarantee similar results in real trading environments. Trading with real funds involves significant risks.
No financial advice: The bots do not constitute financial advice. Users should always seek advice from a qualified financial advisor before making any decisions that have financial implications.
Limitations on functionality: These bots may not be equipped with all the features available in professional trading systems. They are designed as learning and research tools.
User responsibility: Use of the test bots is at your own risk. The developer assumes no liability for any direct or indirect losses that may arise from using these bots.
